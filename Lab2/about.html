        I am currently study in Duke Kunshan University as a sophomore.<br>
        My intended major is Cumputation and Design with the track Digital Media.But I intent to study Cultural Anthropoly in the graduate school.<br>
        I am a leader of the DKU's kpop club and I am also a member of the DKU chorus.<br>
        I am a big fan of BTS and I am also a big fan of the Korean drama. Recently I began to learn Korean and wish that I could visit South Korea and communicate with Korean without any translation assistant tools. <br>
        I hope that I could combine Digital elements and Anthropology elements in my future career. Since the fieldwork methods of Anthropology is quite similar to UX design, I hope I can apply the knowledge I learned to further study.<br>
