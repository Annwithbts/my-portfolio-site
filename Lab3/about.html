    <h1>Welcome to my About page!</h1>
    <p>
        I am currently study in Duke Kunshan University as a sophomore.</p> 
    <p>  My intended major is Cumputation and Design with the track Digital Media.But I intent to study Cultural Anthropoly in the graduate school.</p> 
    <p>  I am a leader of the DKU's kpop club and I am also a member of the DKU chorus.</p> 
    <p>  I am a big fan of BTS and I am also a big fan of the Korean drama. Recently I began to learn Korean and wish that I could visit South Korea and communicate with Korean without any translation assistant tools. </p> 
    <p>  I hope that I could combine Digital elements and Anthropology elements in my future career. Since the fieldwork methods of Anthropology is quite similar to UX design, I hope I can apply the knowledge I learned to further study.</p>
