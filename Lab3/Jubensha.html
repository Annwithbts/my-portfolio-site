    <h1>Welcome to my Jubensha: Awaking Beyond the Caves of Dreams.</h1>
    <p>This is a basic introduction to my project which contains some basic information and core design elements.</p>
    <h2>Narrative Part</h2>
    <p>In Awakening Beyond the Cave of Dreams, the narrative is devided into three parts: scripts for the host and players, visual design, and clue production. There are five scripts in total: one for the host and four for the players. The host script guides gameplay and reveals the truth, while each player's script presents their personal journey over three acts. After reading their scripts, players must gather clues and discuss the mystery together under the host's guidance. </p>
    <p>Jubensha, known for their murder mysteries, give players distinct characters with diverse motives and conflicts. The genre often explores societal issues in depth through intricate backstories and motivations related to crime scenes. Topics such as school violence, domestic abuse, LGBTQ+ rights, abortion, and social injustices are woven into the storylines. Although jubensha has elements of entertainment, its immersive gameplay demands that players approach their characters' perspectives seriously, ensuring that sensitive issues are not trivialized but critically explored.</p>
    
    <h2>Visual Design</h2>
    <p> The visual design centers on dreamlike aesthetics, featuring a predominantly blue color palette with butterfly imagery. The title and layout design align with the dream theme. My friends generously contributed character illustrations, which I adjusted to blend with the backgrounds. Clue cards were created using images sourced from various websites and edited to match the overall style. Audio clues are accessible via QR codes.</p>

    <h2>Clue</h2>
    <p>Inspired by our class, I developed two types of clues: pure sound effects and dialogue-based clues. By combining audio clips, I produced coherent sound effects that hint at the events that transpired. These clues are essential for piecing together the story, offering players hints and deeper insights into the unfolding events through the characters' conversations set against a carefully chosen musical backdrop.</p>
